            <h2 class="card-title">Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, my interests are as diverse as they come. 
                I have a deep-rooted passion for healthcare, driven by the belief that technology can revolutionize the way we deliver and access healthcare services. 
                Additionally, I'm a dedicated advocate for animal welfare, actively involved in various initiatives aimed at improving the lives of our furry friends.</p>
                <p>On the creative side, I find joy in the art of cooking, experimenting with different cuisines, and discovering new vegan recipes. 
                    Drawing is another cherished hobby of mine, where I find solace and inspiration in the strokes of a pencil or the digital canvas. 
                    And to unwind and add a bit of excitement to my life, I have a soft spot for horror movies. The suspense and thrill of a well-crafted horror flick are the perfect escape from the daily grind.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, like a true millennial, I proudly wear the title of "dog mom," sharing my life with a lovable canine companion who brings boundless joy and purpose to my life. 
                        From long walks to cuddles on the couch, every moment with my four-baby is pure love.</p>
